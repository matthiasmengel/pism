Ross flow model example
=================

This example demonstrates regional modeling of ice shelves.  We do only one-time step, a "diagnostic run" to compute the flow velocity of the floating ice.  This example is an update of the EISMINT-Ross intercomparison experiment (below), using more recent data, a 5km data set for the entire Antarctic ice sheet.  This example can be modified to build diagnostic models of any Antarctic ice shelf.

Input datasets
==========

We use the two public datasets:
* *An improved Antarctic dataset for high resolution numerical ice sheet models (ALBMAP v1)*  by A. M. Le Brocq, A. J. Payne, and A. Vieli (http://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.734145)
* *MEaSUREs InSAR-Based Antarctica Velocity Map*  by Rignot, E., J. Mouginot, and B. Scheuchl. 2011, (http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0484.html)

From these data sets, the following fields are used:
* ice thickness (equivalently: the upper/lower surface elevation pair),
* ice surface temperature,
* ice surface mass balance,
* bedrock topography, and
* u and v components of the surface ice velocity for grounded ice as boundary conditions for the floating ice shelf.


Running the example
=================

This directory contains two scripts:
* `preprocess.py`: downloads and preprocessing input data, and
* `run.sh`: use PISM's SSA stress balance to do a "diagnostic" run which computes flow velocity from geometry, ice hardness (a function of temperature), and observed velocities at the grounding line as boundary conditions.

Do:

    $ ./preprocess.py
    $ ./run.sh

Notes
====

* periodic boundary conditions at boundaries of the modeling domain
* several fields have jumps at domain boundaries
* clearly needs boundary conditions at the ice shelf front (`-cfbc`); runs with `-pik` or `-cfbc -part_grid -kill_icebergs` but not with `-cfbc` alone or `-cfbc -part_grid` or `-cfbc -part_grid` or `-cfbc -kill_icebergs`
