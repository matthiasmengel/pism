This DEPRECATED directory contains the script efgrun.sh which does
the runs for the paper
  A. Aschwanden, E. Bueler, C. Khroulev, H. Blatter (2012).  An enthalpy
  formulation for glaciers and ice sheets. Journal of Glaciology 58 (209),
  441â€“457.
Those runs were done under late pism0.3 (I think).

First, run eisgreen/preprocess.sh to create the input file
"eis_green_smoothed.nc".  Then link to it.  Then run the script here.
In summary:

$ (cd ../eisgreen && ./preprocess.sh)
$ ln -s ../eisgreen/eis_green_smoothed.nc

FIXME: efgrun.sh needs eismint_config.nc which seems not to be there

$ export PISM_DO=echo          # in order to see what the run will do
$ ./efgrun.sh N                # N = number of processors
$ export PISM_DO=
$ ./efgrun.sh N >> out.efgrun  # do the run and save the stdout
