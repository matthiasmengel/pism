WARNING:  These scripts worked in the stable0.4 release of PISM.  They may need
update to work in stable0.5.

The scripts in this file demonstrate how to tune PDD parameters to match
regional climate model output available in a publicly-available data set.

The data set we use is the v1.1 version of the SeaRISE-Greenland data:
  http://websrv.cs.umt.edu/isis/images/a/a5/Greenland_5km_v1.1.nc
  
The fields "presprcp", "runoff", and "smb" (surface mass balance) in this data
set are from the RACMO/GR model.  They are described in this paper:
  Ettema J., et al. (2009), "Higher surface mass balance of the Greenland ice
  sheet revealed by high-resolution climate modeling", Geophys. Res. Lett.,
  36, L12501, doi:10.1029/2009GL038110

The tuning procedure is to adjust these PDD parameters; [X] is default value:
  pdd_positive_threshold_temp [273.15 K]
  pdd_factor_snow             [0.003 m K-1 day-1]
  pdd_refreeze                [0.6]
  pdd_std_dev_lapse_lat_rate  [0.0 K degree_north-1]

The degree-day factor for ice (pdd_factor_ice) is set to exactly double that for
snow; see Hock (2005) for example.

A line search is done over this variable, to get the total surface mass balance 
from PISM to exactly equal that from RACMO/GR:
  pdd_std_dev                 [2.53 K]

The top-level script is dotune.sh.  It does this for each case:
  -- calls linesearch.py
  -- calls objective.py to compute differences between 'smb' and 'acab'
Additional actions are needed before and after using dotune.sh.

Recipe:

1.  download and clean-up metadata in the SeaRISE-Greenland file, in preparation
for next steps; correct units on 'smb':
  $ ./preprocess.sh

2.  create a PISM-output file of the type pclimate can read:
  $ ./boot.sh >> log.boot

3.  run pclimate over ranges of parameters, generating cases and evaluating the
difference relative to Ettema's surface mass balance; calls linesearch.py;
generates textfile "diffs.txt" but deletes pclimate outputs and config files:
  $ ./dotune.sh >> out.dotune &
WAIT until it is finished; monitor diffs.txt (e.g. using "less")

4.  find the cases which have small smb difference, or with the lowest values of
the weighted objective:
  $ ./below.py -a -c 2 -l 0.0001 diffs.txt | wc -l  # counts cases with smb diff
                                                    #   under TOL=0.0001
  $ ./below.py -c 5 -l 5.0 diffs.txt | wc -l  # counts cases with weighted < 5.0
  $ ./below.py -c 5 -l 5.0 diffs.txt          # shows same cases

5.  once you have a case you like from the above, with a name like this,
        clim_268_0.001_0.4_0.300_1.0.nc,
regenerate the pclimate output, and the corresponding config file:
  $ ./linesearch.py --reproduce=clim_268_0.001_0.4_0.300_1.0.nc \
       --startfile=start.nc
here is a way to make it nicer to look at by masking with (thk>0):
  $ ./thkmask.py -H start.nc -v acab,smelt,srunoff,saccum \
       clim_268_0.001_0.4_0.300_1.0.nc

6.  view it, comparing to target field 'smb' in same units in data file:
  $ ncview clim_268_0.001_0.4_0.300_1.0.nc &
  $ ncview pism_Greenland_5km_v1.1.nc &
note that, besides in the file names, the PDD parameter choices are attributes
of variable 'pism_overrides' in the NetCDF files from pclimate
