PISM is documented by two PDF manuals for users.  For developers there is also
an HTML browser giving class structure and additional documentation of various 
kinds.

    
  PISM User's Manual (PDF)          [doc/manual.pdf]
  
      This manual is hand-generated; doc/userman/*.tex are the LaTeX sources.
      Thus it can easily get out-of-date relative to the source files for PISM,
      but the goal is to keep it up to date.

      The goal of the User's Manual is, naturally, to help people use PISM.
      That is, to use its existing abilities, those which don't require
      modifying the source code. A secondary goal is for users to understand
      what PISM is doing, more seriously addressed in the developer
      documentation below. A final goal is to specify those capabilities which
      the PISM developers will attempt to maintain in all future stable
      versions. PISM features/capabilities which are not documented in the
      User's Manual should be presumed to be unstable (in the software sense!).


  PISM Installation Manual (PDF)    [doc/installation.pdf]
  
      This manual is hand-generated; doc/installation.tex is the LaTeX source.

  PISM Browser (HTML)               [doc/doxy/html/index.html]
                        
      Automatically generated by doxygen.  See doxygen configuration file 
      doc/browser/doxyfile.  The sources for the Browser are *all* source files
      in src/, regardless of whether doxygen-readable comments appear.
