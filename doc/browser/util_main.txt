/*! \mainpage PISM utility classes (grid management, parallel communication, NetCDF I/O, etc)

This source code browser documents the PISM classes that form the infrastructure
for PISM's implementations of physical models. These classes are not
ice-sheet-modeling specific, but would any support shallow, two-dimensional,
regular grid, parallel scientific computations which need NetCDF input and output.
These classes could be used as a separate library.

Click on "Classes" above to see the full list of classes in this library.  Some
key classes include:

- IceGrid
- IceModelVec2S, IceModelVec2Stag, IceModelVec2V, and IceModelVec3
- PISMComponent, PISMComponent_Diag and PISMComponent_TS
- Timeseries
- PISMNCFile
- PIO

The following pages describe some important infrastructure concepts and techniques:

- \ref computational_grid "Organization of PISM's computational grid"
- \ref imv_allocation "IceModelVec and friends: storing, reading, writing, accessing 2D and 3D fields"
- \ref pism_components "PISM's model components and their interface"
- \ref timeseries_overview "Reading scalar time-series (Timeseries)"
- \ref nctool_overview "Low-level NetCDF access (NCTool)"
- \ref pismio_overview "Reading and writing gridded data (PISMIO)"
